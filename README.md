## Game Concept
**Teleporters of Time** is a procedural dungeon crawler where the player explores dynamically generated labyrinths, progressing through rooms interconnected by teleporters.  
The objective is survival against waves of enemies that scale in difficulty and rarity, and defeating bosses (**Dasher**, **Slime Boss**, **Lich Boss**) using a complex perk and weapon system (melee and ranged).

The core focus is on replayability, fast tactical decision-making, and adapting to the randomly generated map layout.

## How to Play
